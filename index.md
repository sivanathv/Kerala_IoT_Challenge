# Kerala IoT Challenge
## Introduction
Foxlab Makerspace in association with GTech - Group of Technology Companies in Kerala is launching our prestigious program  “Kerala IoT Challenge 2021”,  with a vision to mould 100 IoT experts in Kerala, hosting on the MuLearn platform. Kerala IoT Challenge is a program designed in 4 levels followed by a hackathon to identify and train quality industry leaders in the IoT domain, while any novice learner can start with layer 1 and others can enter laterally to the desired layer after an evaluation.
## Program Structure:
### [Level 1: Basic Electronics and Arduino](#level1)
### Level 2: Introduction to IoT
### Level 3: IoT Intermediate
### Level 4: IoT Advanced

# Level 1: Basic Electronics & Arduino
## Introduction to Arduino
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.
